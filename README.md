# Horiseon Refactor

## Description

The marketing agency Horiseon tasked me with refactoring the existing code of the Horiseon webpage. This refactoring had two aspects: to add accessibility elements to the code; and to 
improve and consolidate HTML and CSS semantic elements. The refactoring was requested to improve search engine optimization for the site.
